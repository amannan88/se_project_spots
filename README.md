# Project 3: Spots: A photo sharing application

**Description:**
An interactive social media web application. Users will be able to add and remove photos, like photos from other users, and make minor adjustments to their profile.

**Technologies and Techniques:**
HTML and Advanced CSS are used in the project. To achieve responsive design, where the webpage adapts to different screen sizes. I have used tools like CSS Grid,Flexbox, media queries, and other techniques to create a layout that looks great on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

**Pictures, GIFs and Screenshots:**
Spots brand logo is used and also favicon added in the root directory

Avatar.jpg used as a placeholder image for profile photo of the user which will be personalised later using Javascript.

Six images are placed as cards in the content area of the page which are uploaded by the user.

**Application Layout:** Deployment via Github pages
